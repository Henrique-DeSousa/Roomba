# Roomba Project using Arduino Uno and XBee

This project's purpose was to allow us to understand and play with the Registries of the Arduino Uno while sending commands from a platform such as OpenHab [see the repository ACIC](https://github.com/Henrique-DeSousa/ACIC-2023-G4) to control or let the Roomba go on its own. The Roomba is made up of 2 ultrasonic sensors, one for Vertical and the other for Horizontal height, and 3 motors of which 2 are for the wheels and 1 for the fan.


Some of the functions towards the end were provided.
